In this two part tutorial, you will learn to code the core functionality of the game (part 1), which includes taking user guess via key input and checking the solution, and add improvements (part 2), which includes adding a clickable keyboard, using the official wordlist, and bugfixing. 

All this is done using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
